  <h2>2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix</h2>
  <img src="images/story1.png" alt="GrandPrix">
  <p>The 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Etihad Airways Abu Dhabi Grand Prix 2021) was a Formula One motor race held on 12 December 2021 at the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Contested over a distance of 58 laps, the race was the twenty-second and final round of the 2021 Formula One World Championship. The race decided both the Drivers' and Constructors' championships; Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton both had 369.5 points coming into the race.</p>
  <p> Hamilton led most of the race and appeared on course to win the race. Verstappen overtook Hamilton on the final lap after a controversial safety car restart in the last moments of the race. The controversy stemmed from race director Michael Masi's decision to allow only a partial number of lapped cars to un-lap themselves before the restart, a move that was seen as inconsistent with usual race procedures and sparked debate over whether it was done to influence the outcome of the championship.</p>
  <p> The FIA conducted an inquiry into the race, confirming Verstappen as the winner and validating the championship results. The report concluded that race director Michael Masi acted in good faith, though differing interpretations of the rules contributed to confusion, particularly regarding the safety car unlapping procedure. The inquiry also led to Masi’s removal as race director and prompted recommendations to clarify safety car regulations and limit team-radio communications with race control. Controversy stemming from Masi's actions significantly contributed to the direction of reforms aimed at restructuring and modernising race operations by Mohammed Ben Sulayem during his tenure as FIA President.</p>
  <p> Verstappen's win secured his first Formula One World Drivers' Championship of his career by eight points from Hamilton, and Red Bull Racing's first since 2013. Mercedes won their eighth consecutive Formula One World Constructors' Championship, setting a new record. The Grand Prix was also the final race for 2007 World Champion Kimi Räikkönen; the 42-year-old Finn retired from Formula One after a two-decade career spanning (a then record setting) 349 Grand Prix starts.</p>
