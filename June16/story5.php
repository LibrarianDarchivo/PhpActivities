  <img src="images/story5.jpg" alt="Pinocchio">
  <p>Once upon a time, there was an old carpenter named Gepetto. He was lonely and wanted someone to keep him company, so he carved a puppet in the shape of a boy and named it Pinocchio.</p>
  <p>Gepetto loved Pinocchio dearly, but the puppet was quite naughty and rarely spoke the truth. Whenever he lied, his wooden nose would grow long! Pinocchio always promised to be a good boy from the next time, but he soon forgot his word and left school to join a circus with his friends.</p>
  <p>One day, Pinocchio heard that his father had been swallowed up by a huge whale. He immediately went to find the whale and was swallowed up as well. Inside the whale’s belly, Pinocchio and Gepetto were so happy to see each other. They made a plan to get out and began tickling the whale’s stomach. As soon as the whale opened his mouth and sneezed, Pinocchio and Gepetto slipped out.</p>
  <p>They reached home safely, and the fairy was pleased with Pinocchio’s bravery. She turned him into a real flesh and blood boy. From that day on, Pinocchio was a very good boy and never missed school. The father and son lived happily ever after.</p>
  <p>But remember, if Pinocchio ever lied again, his nose would grow long once more!
    This story teaches us the importance of honesty, bravery, and family. Always try to be truthful and have the courage to face challenges. And most importantly, cherish the people you love and make them feel valued.</p>
