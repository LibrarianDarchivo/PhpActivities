  <h2>Aladdin and the Magic Lamp</h2>
  <img src="images/story3.jpg" alt="Aladin">
  <p>Once upon a time, in a busy city in Arabia, there lived a kind and curious boy named Aladdin. He was poor and lived in a small house with his mother. Even though they didn’t have much, Aladdin always dreamed of a better life.</p>
  <p> One day, while Aladdin was playing in the market, a strange man came up to him. “I’m your uncle,” the man said, smiling. But he was lying. He was actually a mean sorcerer looking for something special.

The man told Aladdin about a secret treasure hidden in a cave and asked him for help. Aladdin was excited and agreed to go.

They traveled far into the mountains, where the man moved a huge rock and opened the cave. “Go inside and bring me the old lamp,” the man said. “But don’t touch anything else.”</p>

<p>Inside the cave, Aladdin saw piles of gold, shiny jewels, and treasures everywhere! But he remembered the warning and walked past it all until he found the dusty, plain lamp sitting on a small table.

He grabbed the lamp and came back to the entrance, but the sorcerer wanted the lamp before helping Aladdin out. Aladdin refused. Angry, the sorcerer trapped Aladdin inside the cave and ran away.

Aladdin sat in the dark and felt scared. He rubbed the lamp to clean it—and POOF! A giant cloud of smoke appeared. A magical genie popped out!

“I am the Genie of the Lamp,” he said. “You set me free, so I will give you three wishes.”

Aladdin’s eyes lit up. “I wish to go home!” he said. In a flash, he was back in his house.
</p>

<p> Aladdin told his mother everything. They used the genie’s help to live more comfortably. For his second wish, Aladdin asked to become a prince—because he had seen the beautiful Princess Jasmine and wanted to marry her.

Dressed in shining clothes and riding a fancy horse, Aladdin visited the palace. The Sultan liked him and agreed that Jasmine and Aladdin could marry. Jasmine liked that Aladdin was kind and brave—not just rich.

But the sorcerer wasn’t done. He found out Aladdin had the magic lamp. He disguised himself as a peddler and tricked Princess Jasmine into trading the lamp for a shiny new one. She didn’t know it was magical!

Now holding the lamp, the sorcerer told the genie to take the palace, Jasmine, and all the treasure to a faraway desert.

When Aladdin came home and saw the palace gone, he was heartbroken—but not for long. He set off on a journey and used his clever mind to find the sorcerer.
</p>

<p> With courage and smarts, Aladdin got the lamp back. He rubbed it and made his third and final wish: “Please bring my palace and Jasmine home, just as they were.”

The genie nodded and granted the wish. The palace returned, and Aladdin and Jasmine were safe again.

Aladdin looked at the genie and smiled. “You’re free now,” he said.

The genie was so happy. “Thank you, Aladdin!” he said before flying off into the sky.

Soon after, Aladdin and Jasmine were married in a big, joyful celebration. They ruled the kingdom with kindness and fairness, and Aladdin never forgot what he learned: being honest and brave is the greatest treasure of all.
